# Skin-Cancer-and-Pneumonia-Detection
This project applies deep learning to medical imaging with two models: a CNN for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays (binary classification) and a fine-tuned ResNet50 for multi-class skin disease identification. Both use a standardized pipeline (preprocessing, augmentation, training) with TensorFlow/Keras, demonstrating AI's healthcare potential
